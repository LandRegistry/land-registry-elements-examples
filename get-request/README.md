To run this demo:

* `node build.js`
* Open index.html in your web browser

** Note - this demo makes a GET request directly to the heroku application at [land-registry-elements.herokuapp.com](http://land-registry-elements.herokuapp.com) to purposely demonstrate that the pattern library is running on independent infrastructure. It is not recommended that your production system's pipeline relies on the heroku instance which is running on heroku's free tier. (And is therefore required to sleep for at least 6 hours in every 24!)**
